## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public issue
Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to prevent exploitation.

### 2. **Email us directly**
Send an email to: `security@yourdomain.com` (replace with actual email)

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if any)
- Your contact information

### 3. **Response Timeline**
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Resolution**: Within 30 days (depending on complexity)

### 4. **Disclosure Policy**
- We will work with you to coordinate disclosure
- Credit will be given to the reporter (unless requested otherwise)
- Public disclosure will occur after the vulnerability is fixed

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Client-Side Security

This project uses vanilla JavaScript and runs entirely in the browser. Key security considerations:

#### Data Storage
- **localStorage**: Data is stored locally in the user's browser
- **No server communication**: All data remains on the client side
- **Data isolation**: Each user's data is isolated to their browser

#### Input Validation
- **Client-side validation**: All form inputs are validated before processing
- **XSS Prevention**: User input is properly escaped to prevent XSS attacks
- **Input sanitization**: HTML content is escaped using `textContent` and `innerHTML` safely

#### Code Security
- **No external dependencies**: Reduces attack surface
- **Content Security Policy**: Consider implementing CSP headers
- **HTTPS**: Always serve over HTTPS in production

### Best Practices Implemented

#### Input Sanitization
```javascript
// Example from the codebase
escapeHtml(text) {
    const div = document.createElement('div');
    div.textContent = text;
    return div.innerHTML;
}
```

#### Error Handling
```javascript
// Example from the codebase
try {
    localStorage.setItem('data', JSON.stringify(data));
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Error saving data:', error);
    // Graceful fallback
}
```

#### Event Delegation
- Prevents memory leaks
- Reduces potential for event-based attacks
- More efficient event handling

### Security Features

#### Contact Form Security
- **Email validation**: Prevents malformed email addresses
- **Length limits**: Prevents buffer overflow attempts
- **Input sanitization**: All user input is properly escaped
- **Form validation**: Prevents submission of malicious data

#### Todo App Security
- **Input limits**: Maximum character limits on todo text
- **Data validation**: All todo data is validated before storage
- **Safe rendering**: Todo content is safely rendered to prevent XSS

## 🔍 Security Audit Checklist

When reviewing the code for security issues, check:

### Input Validation
- [ ] All user inputs are validated
- [ ] Input length limits are enforced
- [ ] Special characters are properly handled
- [ ] Email format validation is implemented

### Data Handling
- [ ] User data is properly escaped
- [ ] localStorage operations are wrapped in try-catch
- [ ] No sensitive data is stored in localStorage
- [ ] Data serialization is safe

### DOM Manipulation
- [ ] innerHTML is used safely with escaped content
- [ ] Event listeners are properly managed
- [ ] No eval() or similar dangerous functions
- [ ] Event delegation is used appropriately

### Error Handling
- [ ] Errors are caught and handled gracefully
- [ ] No sensitive information is exposed in error messages
- [ ] User-friendly error messages are displayed
- [ ] Console errors are logged appropriately

## 🚫 Known Limitations

### Client-Side Only
- **No server-side validation**: All validation happens in the browser
- **No authentication**: No user authentication system
- **No authorization**: No access control mechanisms
- **No data encryption**: Data is stored in plain text in localStorage

### Browser Dependencies
- **localStorage availability**: Depends on browser support
- **JavaScript enabled**: Requires JavaScript to function
- **Modern browser**: Requires modern browser features

## 🔧 Security Recommendations

### For Developers
1. **Regular updates**: Keep dependencies updated (though this project uses none)
2. **Code review**: Review all code changes for security issues
3. **Testing**: Test security features thoroughly
4. **Documentation**: Document security considerations

### For Users
1. **HTTPS**: Always access over HTTPS
2. **Browser updates**: Keep browser updated
3. **Data backup**: Export important data regularly
4. **Privacy**: Be aware that data is stored locally

### For Deployment
1. **HTTPS only**: Serve over HTTPS in production
2. **Security headers**: Implement appropriate security headers
3. **Content Security Policy**: Consider implementing CSP
4. **Regular audits**: Perform regular security audits

## 📋 Security Incident Response

### Incident Classification
- **Critical**: Data breach, XSS vulnerability
- **High**: Authentication bypass, data exposure
- **Medium**: Input validation issues, minor XSS
- **Low**: Information disclosure, minor issues

### Response Process
1. **Immediate**: Assess and contain the issue
2. **Short-term**: Develop and deploy fix
3. **Long-term**: Review and improve security measures
4. **Communication**: Notify users if necessary

## 🔄 Security Updates

Security updates will be released as needed. Users should:
- Monitor the repository for updates
- Update to the latest version promptly
- Report any security concerns immediately

## 📞 Contact Information

For security-related questions or concerns:
